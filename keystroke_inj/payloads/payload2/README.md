## Necessary files

I have not added the neccessary files for obvious reasons, however you can download them your self by googling for them.

The files needed will be:

    Mimikatz32.exe and Mimikatz64.exe
  
    Webbrowserpassview.exe
  
A simple google search of the names as i wrote them should take you to the right place.

Ensure that Webbrowserpassview.exe is the command enabled version, else you wont be able to save the passwords fromt he command line.

The files should be renames as follows:

    Mimikatz32.exe -> mimikatz32.exe
  
    Mimikatz64.exe -> mimikatz64.exe
  
    Webbrowserpassview.exe -> webpass.exe


Remember to place those new files into the root directory of the server
